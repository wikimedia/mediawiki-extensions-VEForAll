VEForAll ("VisualEditor For All") is a MediaWiki extension that provides
the ability for other extensions to make use of VisualEditor within
textareas. VEForAll does not do anything on its own; rather, it defines a
JavaScript function, applyVisualEditor(), which can be called on any
textarea input.

As you might expect, the VisualEditor extension must be installed for VEForAll
to work.

This extension includes the file ApiParsoidUtils.php, whose contents are
mostly copied from the files ApiParsoidUtils.php and Utils.php in the
StructuredDiscussions extension. See that extension for attribution.
