VEForAll ("VisualEditor For All") is a MediaWiki extension that provides
the ability for other extensions to make use of VisualEditor within
textareas. VEForAll does not do anything on its own; rather, it defines a
JavaScript function, applyVisualEditor(), which can be called on any
textarea input.

As you might expect, the VisualEditor extension must be installed for VEForAll
to work.
